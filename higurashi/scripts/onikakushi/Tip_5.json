      "The villagers understand that the stalling was caused by sublime power through unity",
      "and they understand that this fearsome plan has not yet been fully withdrawn.",
      "The Onigafuchi Defense Alliance had been dissolved after it did its part, but the feelings of unity it garnered have not yet been extinguished.",
