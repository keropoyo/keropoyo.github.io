      "信じられないくらい、冷静な表情で俺の左右に散った。",
      "１人はバットに組み付き、もう１人は俺を組み伏せる、そういう算段か。",
      "…１対２では…どうにもならない！！",
      "体中から熱い汗がどっと吹き出る。",
      "ならば先手必勝だ！！",
      "先に踏み込み、１人を打ち崩すッ！！！",
      "先に先制攻撃を加えた右の男に的を絞り、渾身の踏み込みによる強打を振り上げる。",
      "素手の人間にとって、どのような防ぎ方をしても…致命的なダメージになる！！",
      "腕で防げば骨ごとへし折り、背中でかばえば内臓の奥にまでダメージを送り込むことが可能！！",
      "相手もそれを理解しているようだった。",
      "俺の必殺の間合いのさらに内側に飛び込み、その拳で俺の腹部を狙う！！！",
      "まずい…、この間合い、この姿勢、この状態では…回避する術は何もない！！",
      "世界がでんぐり返り、自分の体がまるで木の葉のように…軽々と吹っ飛んでいくのがわかった。",
      "音もなく、柔らかに地面に打ち付けられ、顔面でがりがりとした砂利の感触を味わう。",
      "…痛みはなかった。",
      "……と思ったのもつかの間、すぐに皮膚が擦り剥けるあの嫌な痛みと、胃の内容物がこみ上げてくる時にする、あの苦い感覚が口中を満たす。",
      "そんな痛みを堪能する時間もないことを、今の俺はよく理解していた。",
      "すぐに立ち上がるが、その時にはすでに次の男が眼前に迫ってきていた。",
      "…回避できないことを冷静に理解できることが、かえって悔しい。",
      "もう一度、腹に渾身の一撃を入れると、そいつはぐるっと俺の背後にまわり、ぶっとい腕で俺の首をがっちりとロックする！！",
      "…凄まじい腕力に、喉がつぶされるッ！！",
      "窒息するとか昏倒するとか、そんな理屈は思いつかなかった。",
      "…ただ、視界が真っ暗になり、頭の奥でじーーんという音が聞こえるだけ。",
      "意識を途切れないように保つのだけが精一杯だった。",
      "こうしてもがいてる間にも、もう一人の男は無防備になった俺の真正面に立っているに違いない。",
      "目を開けることはできなかったが、気配でそれを感じることができる。",
      "俺になす術はない。",
      "腕も振り解けず、逃げることも反撃することもできない。",
      "絶対絶命…という複雑な単語は、もう思いつかなかった……………………。"

      "They didn't respond.",
      "They spread out to either side of me with unbelievably calm expressions on their faces.",
      "One of them would grab onto my bat and the other would hold me down... was that their plan?",
      "Taking on both of them at once... would be impossible!!",
      "Hot sweat poured from every pore in my body.",

      "Narrowing my target down to the man on the right who had already been knocked down before, I stepped in and swung with all my might.",
      "There was no way for an unarmed person to guard against it... it would cause immense damage!!",
      "If they blocked it with their arm, their bone would snap like a twig; if they turned their back to it, then it was possible that the blow would travel all the way to their vital organs!",
      "It looked like he was aware of this.",
      "He pushed farther through the kill zone between us and delivered a fist right into my gut!!!",
      "Not good... with this distance, in this position and in this state... there was no way for me to dodge it!!",
      "The world flipped upside-down... I understood that I was being tossed around like a rag doll.",

      "I knew very well that I didn't have the time to relish this experience.",
      "I stood up as quickly as I could. But at that moment, the other man was already barreling towards me.",
      "...Being able to comprehend calmly that I simply couldn't dodge it made it all the more upsetting.",
      "After plowing into my stomach full-force once again, my assailant twisted around behind me and locked his thick arm around my neck!!",
      "...My throat felt like it was being crushed by his immense strength!!",
      "I couldn't even contemplate that I was being strangled, or that I was about to go unconscious.",
      "...My vision simply darkened and a silent whining noise began playing deep inside my mind.",
      "It took everything I had to keep myself from blacking out.",
      "While this was happening, the other man was more than likely standing in front of me.",
      "I wasn't able to open my eyes, but I could feel that he was there.",
      "There was nothing I could do now.",
      "Unable to shake this arm off me, I couldn't run. I couldn't fight back.",
