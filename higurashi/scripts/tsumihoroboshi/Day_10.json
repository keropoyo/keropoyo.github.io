      "これだけ暑い日が続けば、死体は痛むのもあっという間だった。",
      "台所を預かる主婦たちなら、これだけの生肉があっという間にそうなることなど、誰だってわかる。",
      "だから、重要な解体作業は一番最初にやった。",
      "解体する理由はただひとつ。",
      "死体を絶対見つからない場所に持ち運ぶため、隠して運べるサイズにする必要があったからだ。",
      "死体を切り刻む、と文字に書くと嫌悪感を感じるのは多分、台所に立たない男の人だけだろう。",
      "まな板の前に立つ主婦は、魚を捌けば内臓を引き出すし、生だったらまだ動いている寄生虫を見ることだってある。",
      "そういうのを引きずり出したり、時には付いたまま加熱して料理してしまうこともある。",
      "火を通せば無害というやつだ。",
      "男の人は言葉を聞いただけで毛嫌いするから、台所を見せないだけのこと。",
      "だから、別にこんな作業はへっちゃらだった。",
      "それに、こいつらを殺すことで全ての悩みから開放されたのだ。",
      "その喜びと引き換えなら、これくらいの後片付けは当然だった。",
      "鋸や鉈などの大工道具を使って分解する。",
      "返り血を浴びるだろうから、わざわざ黒いジャージを買っておいた。",
      "血が付いてても目立たないし、最後には捨ててしまえばいい。",
      "もちろん、付近に血が飛び散るかもしれないと思い、捨ててあったブルーシートも拾ってきてあった。",
      "この上で作業をすれば、最後には丸めて焼いてしまえばいいからとても便利だ。",
      "……結局、人間の解体も、まな板の上での炊事と何にも変わらないわけだ。",
      "実際、これだけ大きな体なのだから、かなりくたびれたが、そう悩まずに分解できた。",
      "手、足、首を切断し、ちょうど６分割にした。",
      "死体を切ると、脂で刃が駄目になる…というようなのを、どこかで聞いていたので、予め分解道具は豊富に用意した。",
      "その予想は的中し、私は解体途中で道具を取りに帰るという無様なまねをせずに済んだ。",
      "そう言えば昔、ダム戦争の末期にまさにこの地で、現場監督のバラバラ殺人があったんだっけ。",
      "それも確かこれと同じで６分割のはず。",
      "もっとも私は２人分だから１２分割なのだけど。",
      "そう言えば、逮捕されていない主犯が隠したという腕は、未だ発見されていないんだっけ。",
      "どこに隠したんだろうな。",
      "その場所を教えてもらいたいなと思い、ちょっと苦笑した。",
      "手足や首はともかく、胴体は大きくて大変だった。",
      "分解できないかとも考えたが、臓物の処分などで相当面倒になるだろうと思い、結局断念する。",
      "分解した断片を、黒いゴミ袋にしまい、どうせ効果はないだろうが冷蔵庫用の消臭剤たっぷりと一緒に何重にも包む。",
      "解体作業中にもだいぶ虫に群がられたが、綺麗にゴミ袋にまとめた後は、血の匂いに群がっているだけのようだった。",
      "全ての後片付けをした後には、もう虫も散っていた。",
      "あとは、この１２個の黒い肉袋を処分するだけ。",
      "骨になるまで焼ければ一番楽だけど、火葬場でもなければ無理だろう。",
      "どこか秘密の場所に埋めてしまうのがいい。",
      "胴体はともかく、それ以外の袋はナップザックに詰められる大きさだ。",
      "容易に隠して持ち運べるだろう。",
      "このダム現場を貫いて流れる沢に流してしまえたら楽だなと思った。",
      "でも、そんなことすれば絶対に下流で誰かが見つける。",
      "たまにニュースで、川原で見つかったボストンバッグから遺体の一部が…、何てのを見るけど、流した犯人のいい加減さにはいつも呆れていた。",
      "鬼ヶ淵の沼に沈めるのもいいかと思ったけど、肉は腐ると浮力がつく。",
      "重りと一緒なら…とは思うが、絶対に大丈夫とは言い切れない。",
      "だとすると残るのは、地中に埋めることだけ。",
      "谷河内か高津戸辺りの廃村地区をもっと奥に行けば、未開の山がいくつもある。",
      "そんな山のどこかにひっそりと埋めてしまうのが一番だろう。",
      "このゴミ山はかなり安全だが、それでも絶対じゃない。",
      "だから、私はこの袋の山全てを、無事に山奥に埋めてしまって初めて、あの２人の完全な抹消を終了するのだ。",
      "………使い慣れない筋肉を酷使したせいか、体の節々が痛む。",
      "私は丁寧に後片付けをすると、ジャージのまま隠れ家に入り、マットレスの上に横になった。",
      "手は念入りに洗ったけど、爪の間など入り込んだものまでは落としきっていない。",
      "……後でお風呂に入って入念に落とそう。",
      "殺人、死体遺棄と言葉を並べると、何だか自分が世紀の大悪人のように聞こえる。",
      "でもそれは、ばれたらの話だ。",
      "ばれなければ罪じゃないし、…それに私は、罪が犯したくてやったわけじゃない。",
      "私は、悪いことはしていない。",
      "自分とお父さんの生活を守るためにやったんだ。",
      "それを罵る人間は所詮は対岸の人間。",
      "結局、罪なんて、何者にも裁けないのかもしれない。",
      "罪は裁くものではなく、認めて贖罪するものだ。",
      "つまり、罪は犯した本人にしか測れないということ。",
      "私に悔悟や後悔の念は？",
      "ない。",
      "今この瞬間も、私は間違ったことをしたなんて思っていない。",
      "あの２人を殺す以上の最善策などなかったと断言できる。",
      "それに、……あの２人を殺したその夜から、私の生活は少しずつ変わり始めたからだ。",

      "Any housewife knows how fast fresh meat can go bad.",

      "There was only one reason why I needed to dismember them.",
      "I had to reduce them to a portable size, in order to carry them to a place where they'll never be found.",
      "When men see the words \"dismembered corpses,\" they'll probably feel disgusted, because they don't cook.",
      "But housewives are used to taking the guts out of fish, and they sometimes even see living maggots.",
      "They take the maggots off of the food, or even cook it with the maggots still on.",
      "The heat will kill them, after all.",
      "Women don't tell men what they do in the kitchen because men wouldn't eat the food if they knew.",
      "So it didn't really bother me much to dismember them.",
      "I was released from all my problems by killing them.",
      "Cleaning up the mess was like nothing to me, because I got freedom and regained my happiness.",
      "I dismembered the corpses using carpenter's tools like a saw and a hatchet.",
      "I'm wearing a black sweat suit I bought for today because I thought I might get stained with blood.",
      "Bloodstains don't show on black fabric, and I can just throw it away after it's done.",
      "I brought a plastic sheet I found in the dump because I thought the blood might spread otherwise.",
      "If I did the work on this sheet, I could just burn it after I was done.",
      "...In the end, dismembering human bodies is no different from preparing food on a chopping board.",
      "I was very tired from chopping apart two adult bodies, but I didn't have a problem doing it.",
      "I cut off their arms, legs, and heads, dividing each body into six pieces.",
      "I heard before that blades get easily ruined by fat when you cut apart a corpse. So, I brought many kinds of tools.",
      "And I was right. I didn't have to go back and forth between here and my house to get another tool in the middle of work.",
      "A long time ago, the construction manager was murdered and his body was dismembered here during the dam conflict.",
      "He was cut into six pieces in the same way.",
      "Well, I had two bodies, so there was double that, though.",
      "I remembered the main suspect was still on the loose, and the victim's arm he hid hadn't been found yet.",
      "I wonder where he hid it.",
      "I'd like to ask him. I smiled wryly.",
      "Unlike the arms, legs, and heads, the torsos were difficult to take care of.",
      "I thought about cutting them into smaller pieces, but I decided against it because I thought it'd be troublesome to clean up the guts.",
      "I put each piece in a black trash bag and sprayed on a lot of deodorant. I wasn't sure if that would help against the smell, though.",
      "Many bugs flew around me while I was dismembering the corpses. After I finished putting all the pieces into each bag, the bugs were still flying around, but that was just because they could smell the blood.",
      "After I cleaned up everything, they were all gone.",
      "Now all I need to do is get rid of these twelve black bags.",
      "Burning them would be easiest, but I don't think I can burn them to ashes without using a cremator.",
      "The best way is to bury them somewhere.",
      "Other than the torsos, every piece is small enough to fit in my backpack.",
      "I could easily carry them without being noticed.",

      "but if I did that, somebody would find them for sure.",
      "I've seen on the news several times before that a bag with a body part in it was found beside a river... Every time I heard something like that, I always thought the murderer was stupid.",
      "I thought about dumping them into the Onigafuchi Swamp. But rotten meat floats.",
      "I thought about weighting the bags... but there's no guarantee they'd stay down.",
      "So, that left me one choice: to bury them.",
      "There are many unexplored mountains at the end of the abandoned districts around Yagouchi and Takatsudo.",
      "It's probably best to bury them somewhere in the mountains.",
      "While it would be safe to bury them here in the garbage dump, too, it's not perfectly safe.",
      "And so, I'm going to bury all these bags somewhere deep inside of a mountain, in order to completely erase the two of them.",

      "I washed my hands carefully, but there was still dirt and blood under my nails.",
