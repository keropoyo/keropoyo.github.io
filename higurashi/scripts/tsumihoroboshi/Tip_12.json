      "あれは、何年前だったかな。",
      "ある田舎の自然が綺麗な村があってね。",
      "そこがダムに沈むとか何とかで住民運動があったんだ。",
      "その住民団体が、豊かな自然を知ってもらおうと、大自然ウォッチングという名のツアーを開催していたことがあってね。",
      "やがてダムに沈むかもしれない、失われていく自然という雰囲気に引かれて、本当に軽い気持ちで参加したんだよ。",
      "でもね、行って本当に息を呑んだんだよ。",
      "そこは本当に空気が透き通っていて、自然が美しい本当に素晴らしいところだったんだ。",
      "それ以来、お父さんはあの自然にすっかり虜になってしまっていてなぁ。",
      "…ダム計画が中止されたと聞いて喜んでたくらいなんだよ。",
      "あの時、訪れたのがまさに今、家を建てている場所なんだけどね。",
      "あの時は野花が美しい原っぱだったんだ。",
      "その原っぱで、二人組の小さな女の子たちが遊んでいたんだ。",
      "二人とも髪が長くてとても美しい少女たちだった。",
      "ご近所の友達同士だったんだろうね。",
      "幼いながらもきりっとした表情の子と、あどけなさを残す表情の子の顔、今でもよく覚えてるよ。",
      "どちらも将来、それぞれ個性的な美人になるだろうなぁ。",
      "少女たちはくるくると踊るように走り回ってた。",
      "ここは君たちの遊び場なのかいって聞いたらこう言うんだ。",
      "早くここに引っ越してくる人が現れますように、ってね。",
      "見ればそこには「別荘地・売出し中」の看板が立っていた。",
      "その時、あぁ、ここに住んでみるのもいいかもしれないなぁって思ったんだ。",
      "確かにここには何もないし、都会での生活に比べると不便かもしれない。",
      "でも、……父さんなぁ、家族でもう一度生活をやり直すならここしかないって思ったんだ。",
      "前の町では確かにいろいろあったけど、それはもう全部終わったんだから、忘れてしまおう。",
      "過ちから教訓を汲み取り、この村で理想の生活をやり直そう。",
      "だから、圭一がここでの生活を気に入ってくれてると嬉しいんだけどなぁ。",
      "…………そうか。",
      "気に入ってくれてるなら嬉しい。",
      "父さんも、ここに引っ越してきてから家族の仲がとてもよくなって嬉しいんだ。",
      "前の町では、家族はみんなばらばらだったと思う。",
      "…だから、やり直せて本当によかったと思ってるよ。",
      "こうして、圭一と話をする機会も全然なかったしなぁ。",
      "そうだ、圭一。",
      "圭一の学校には、髪の長くて綺麗な二人組の女の子はいないか？",
      "年齢は……多分、圭一よりもっと年下だと思うなぁ。",
      "髪の短い子と長い子ならいる？",
      "ううん、多分違うと思うなぁ。",
      "何で探してるかって？",
      "いやいや、写生のモデルになってもらいたくてねぇ。",
      "色々なコスチュ、げほんげほん！",
      "と、とにかく芸術的な興味でだよ。",
      "見かけたら父さんにも教えてくれよ。",
      "きっとだぞー！",
      "ぐほぐぎぇッ？！"

      "I don't remember how many years ago it was.",
      "There was this beautiful village surrounded by nature.",
      "But the village was going to be submerged in water because of a new dam project, and the villagers protested against it en masse.",
      "They held a sightseeing tour so people from other places could enjoy the local beauty.",
      "I joined the tour out of simple curiosity. I wanted to take a look at the nature that might sink under the water.",
      "But when I got there, the place took my breath away.",
      "The air was so clean and clear, and the landscape was beautiful beyond words.",
      "Since then, I was hooked on the inspiring nature of the place.",
      "...I fell in love with the village so much that I was very glad when I heard that the dam project was canceled.",
      "That village is where I'm building our new house.",
      "When I visited there, I found a beautiful field of wildflowers.",
      "I saw two cute girls playing in that field.",
      "Both of them were very beautiful, with long, straight hair.",
      "They were probably neighbors or best friends.",
      "I still remember how they looked. One of them had a very beautiful face with a clear-cut profile for her age, and the other had a very pretty, innocent look.",
      "I'm sure both of them will grow up into fine, beautiful ladies in the future.",
      "They were running around in the field like they were dancing.",
      "I asked them if the field was their playground.",
      "They said they were playing in hopes that newcomers would move to the village.",
      "Then I saw a sign saying \"lot for sale\".",
      "That was when I began to think that it might be a great place to live.",
      "There was nothing here, and things are a bit inconvenient compared to the life in a city.",
      "But... I sincerely believed this was the best place for us to start a new life together as a family.",
      "A lot of things happened back in the city... but the past is the past. It's best that we move on.",
      "We learn from our mistakes, and I hope we can start a new, more ideal life in this village.",
      "Keiichi, I hope you'll grow to love it here as much as I do.",
      "......You do?",
      "I'm happy to hear that.",
      "I'm also happy that we've been doing a lot better as a family since we moved here.",
      "Back in the city, we were far from close.",
      "...So, I'm truly happy that we're able to start from scratch.",
      "Now that I come to think about it, I've never had a chance to have a conversation with you like this before.",
      "Oh, Keiichi.",
      "Do you know any two beautiful girls with long straight hair in your school?",
      "I think they're... a lot younger than you.",
      "Oh, you know two young beautiful girls but one has short hair, huh?",
      "Hmm... I don't think they're the ones I saw.",
      "You want to know why I asked?",
      "Oh, I just wanted to ask them to be models for my portraits.",
      "I was thinking about making them wear cute costumes... Ahem!",
      "B-Basically, I just wanted to see them again, for artistic reasons.",
      "So, if you happen to see them, let your dad know, okay?",
      "Promise me, okay?!",
      "Cough cough!!"
