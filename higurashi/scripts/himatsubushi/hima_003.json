      "If you didn't include gym or art class, his grades were above average.",
      "That was the result of having private tutoring sessions twice a week.",
      "If you omitted the fact that he still couldn't do pull-ups, there wasn't much else that would make him hate school.",
      "Of course, he understood full well that his grandfather was a cabinet minister.",
      "But he also knew that not too many people were that interested in their relationship.",
      "He didn't like to go out of his way to bring up his grandfather, or to call him the Minister of Construction.",
      "And finally, he at least tried to know a little more about what kind of work the Minister of Construction did than your average Joe.",
      "What that entailed was that when you tried your best to make life better for the masses... sometimes you made a few enemies.",
      "He knew that all too well from the time he'd spent as class representative.",
      "His grandfather had many enemies.",
      "...He knew that he might personally catch some of that fallout, so he had to be twice as cautious.",
      "He was taught that by his parents.",
      "That's why... the moment he was kidnapped, he instantly knew that this was one of those occasions.",
      "He understood that he wasn't being treated as Toshiki Inugai, the person, but rather as Toshiki Inugai, the grandson of the Minister of Construction.",
      "That he wasn't personally at fault, but that this was the result of some unavoidable trouble with his grandfather's work.",
      "...It made little difference, but when he realized it wasn't because of anything he did, he was able to relax, if only a little.",
      "Of course, at first he was struck with a terror befitting his age, wondering what was going to happen to him.",
      "But, after a while of being tied up and only able to stay lying down, he began to ponder a great many things.",
      "First, he thought about the reason he was being abducted like this.",
      "He understood the answer to that easily.",
      "He was taken hostage to coerce his grandfather, the Minister.",
      "There was no doubt about that.",
      "He didn't know exactly what the Minister of Construction did, but it was easy to imagine that there was much to be gained from threatening him.",
      "He respected his grandfather more than most.",
      "He earnestly believed that his own grandfather was within the top 20 of the most important people in Japan.",
      "That was exactly why he wouldn't forgive anybody who tried to threaten his beloved grandfather. More importantly, he wouldn't forgive anybody who would use him as a tool to threaten his grandfather.",
      "His grandfather was really busy, and rarely had time to meet with relatives.",
      "That's why, with what little time he did manage to scrape together, he just dropped by unannounced.",
      "And, as an apology for not being able to meet during new year's or summer vacation, he doted on his grandson, very, very much.",
      "The number of times that Toshiki was looked upon with disregard just because his grandfather was a politician and a minister certainly weren't few.",
      "But he never thought even once that he wanted his grandfather to quit being a politician.",
      "Because it was his beloved grandfather, he wanted him to continue his career as long as possible from the bottom of his heart.",
      "However, Toshiki was now being held hostage, and his grandfather was being threatened.",
      "His grandfather, who called him the apple of his eye, was surely suffering.",
      "He might do anything to save his grandson.",
      "Maybe even putting aside his ideology if it was required to save his grandson.",
      "He might cave into the culprits' demands if it meant saving his grandson.",
      "When Toshiki thought about that...",
      "...an inexplicable anger welled up within him.",
      "In his current situation, he was unable to forgive the cowards who would make his beloved grandfather suffer by using such dastardly means.",
      "That feeling swelled up inside of him, displacing the fear.",
      "What he thought of first, was something any boy would imagine.",
      "Get out of these bonds, beat up the bad guys, then hand them over to the police.",
      "Images of all the brave heroes from all the manga he had read passed through the back of his mind.",
      "In his imaginary scenario, he slipped his bonds easily, floating like a butterfly to evade his captors, then stinging like a bee to bring them all down.",
      "In the end, it was nothing more than his silly little fantasy. But with his vision obstructed and unable to see anything, it was something that he could get into more than any anime at the moment.",
      "In actuality, he was enjoying these little scenarios in his head for the long period of time he was tied up. His captors hadn't really done anything to him that they would feel sorry for.",
      "However, eventually he began to grow tired of his fantasies, and more realistic scenarios began to run through his head. It was then he realized that none of them were a solution.",
      "...Yes, he wanted to do something for his grandfather who was being threatened.",
      "That he was being held here to inflict pain on his grandfather was the thing that he could least forgive, and also the most vexing.",
      "...And then, he noticed.",
      "There was a much simpler way he could save his grandfather without having to beat up his despicable captors.",
      "That was, to remove himself as a hostage from the hands of these villains.",
      "If he was to disappear from here, his captors would have nothing to threaten his grandfather with.",
      "The captors had restrained him, but they didn't treat him roughly, and they made sure he was fed well enough.",
      "...Meaning, at most, he was nothing more than the means for their threat.",
      "They weren't looking to bully or kill him out of spite.",
      "If he behaved, no ill would befall him.",
      "Realizing that gave him a strong sense of courage.",

      "Right now, at this moment, Toshiki Inugai had decided to escape.",
      "His ears had been stuffed with a spongelike material, acting as makeshift earplugs.",
      "...However, they didn't actually do much to block out any sound, and he could overhear everything his captors were saying.",
      "Realizing that this was to his advantage, even when his captors spoke to him, he acted like he couldn't hear them due to the earplugs.",
      "His captors, thinking that he couldn't hear their conversation, talked about all sorts of things without any reservations.",
      "Thanks to that, he was able to obtain various pieces of information.",
      "First off... this wasn't Tokyo.",
      "It seemed that this was quite a distance away, and on top of that in the countryside, nestled deep in the mountains.",
      "It also seemed that his captors were inconvenienced living out here, so he could deduce that this place was far removed from any sort of town.",
      "Finally, whenever they went out to buy food or other supplies, they would always take a car.",
      "That fact caused him some dismay,",
      "because he knew that the method he learned at school of running around blindly while shouting for help wouldn't work here.",
      "He paused his little mental escape scenario there.",
      "His ultimate goal was to find somebody who would help him.",
      "If somebody who fit that description wasn't close by, his chances of escaping successfully grew slim.",
      "A desolate far-off land deep in the mountains.",
      "A place where you couldn't even go shopping without using a car.",
      "...In this situation... escaping would be very difficult.",
      "...He grew depressed, and after a little while, he returned to his original scenario.",
      "Imagining becoming a hero like in the manga he read and beating down his captors became his respite.",
      "However, as he played those delusions out in his head...",
      "His heart, hating to surrender, continued to search for a way to escape.",
      "...And then... he thought of a way.",
      "If the goal was far away, then all he had to do was get closer.",
      "His goal, in a nutshell, was to find somebody who would help him.",
      "In other words, somebody other than his captors.",
      "If he faked being sick, then his captors would have to take him to the hospital, or bring a doctor to him.",
      "They would probably be reluctant to do that.",
      "But, he already knew, that the hostage was more important than anything.",
      "In the off chance that something happened--like him dying--occurred, they wouldn't be able to threaten anybody anymore.",
      "Luckily, he had an experience that would help him fake a serious illness.",
      "At the end of last year.",
      "He was inadvertently involved in a car accident and had to undergo surgery.",
      "The scar from that surgery was still clearly visible on his lower torso.",
      "He recalled the pain and suffering from that time.",
      "The existence of that experience would make a huge impact on the realism of his performance.",
      "...He was quite confident in his ability to fake an illness."
