      "魅音の言葉が、頭の中にずっと残っていた。",
      "死体の見つかった二人がオヤシロさまの祟りなら。",
      "…それを鎮めるための生贄もまた二人。",
      "確かに、祭具殿に忍び込んだのは私たち４人。",
      "計算は合う。",
      "だとすれば、………私や圭一の身にも危険が迫っていたのだろうか…？",
      "…私は気持ちよく眠りこけてしまって、……ここに泊まってしまったが、",
      "それが本当に疲れだけによるものなのか、",
      "……何か料理に睡眠薬が混入されていたのか分からない。",
      "………確かに、私ともあろうものが、疲れと眠気でバタンキューして、よりにもよって祖母の家に泊まり込むなどちょっと考え難い。",
      "祭具殿で気味の悪いことがあって、…それを忘れるために馬鹿騒ぎして。",
      "………それにしたって、話がうますぎだった。",
      "そう思うと。",
      "…あの時、ふと目が覚めたことは本当に…運が良かったことのように思う。",
      "下手をしたら、岩牢の中で目覚めたのは私の方だったのかもしれない。",
      "…偶然に回避していた危機というのは、…認識し難いものだった。",
      "…私はそんな馬鹿なと笑い飛ばしたい気持ちと、紙一重だった恐ろしい想像に震えたい気持ちでぐちゃぐちゃになっていた。",
      "だとするなら。",
      "…もう１人の共犯者、前原圭一は今頃どうしているだろう。",
      "さっきの岩牢の中にはいなかった。",
      "……だからといって、今この瞬間にも無事な保証はない。",
      "鷹野さんたちが「執行」されたのだから。",
      "圭一も「執行」されている可能性はある。",

      "夜が明けたら。",
      "……魅音になり、登校してみるか。",
      "前原圭一の無事を確認してみよう。",
      "……もしすでに失踪しているなら、敵は必ず最後の侵入者である私を狙ってくる。",
      "自らを囮にするしかない。",
      "もし、まだ失踪していないなら。",
      "……前原圭一を注意深く監視する必要がある。",
      "敵はあの間抜けなお調子者をきっと狙うからだ。",
      "…私が魅音になってしまえば、詩音は消える。",
      "敵は、詩音はもう誰かの手によって「鬼隠し」にあったのだろうと思い、圭一に狙いを絞るに違いない。",
      "もしも圭一に何の魔手も迫らないなら。",
      "…………それも結構だろう。",
      "とりあえず、私に危害が及ばないことを確かめられる。",
      "私の目の前には拘束椅子に縛り付けられた鬼婆が、未だ眠り続けている。",

      "…爪どころか、指の数本をちょん切られたって、口を割ったりするものか。",
      "…次期頭首の魅音は逆で、口はあっさり割ったが、何も重要なことは知らなかった。",
      "魅音は自分など取り次ぎに過ぎず、",
      "しかも、ヤバい話は自分以外の誰かを介しているかもしれない、…なんて話をした。",
      "……………魅音が私の知らない内に、とんでもない嘘つきに成長していて、私を真顔で騙した可能性は捨てきれない。",
      "…だが、鬼婆が、ダークサイドを魅音を介さなかったというのは何となく納得できる話でもあった。",
      "私が鬼婆だったら。",
      "私だってあいつは通さないだろうと思ったからだ。",
      "……あいつは、私と違って甘い。",
      "世の中には１と０しかないはずなのに、小数点のついた０．５とか０．７とか、そんな曖昧なことを考えている。",
      "……平たく言うと、残酷になれないってことだ。",
      "もし鬼婆が私と同じかそれ以上に、１と０な考えをできるなら。",
      "……………それはありえる話だった。",
      "その陰の面を取り次ぐ人物、Ｘが、…オヤシロさまの祟りを真の意味で司る人物なのだろうか。",
      "鬼婆が憂慮すると、Ｘが気を利かせて、…直接か、あるいは間接的に働きかけ、執行する。",
      "あるいは鬼婆とＸが合議の上、決めているのか。",
      "しかし、………Ｘなんて…存在するのだろうか？",
      "存在するとすれば、その人物は次期頭首よりもよほど村の深奥に位置する人物だ。",
      "魅音のような若造の甘ちゃんと違い、",
      "…口が堅く、",
      "残酷で、",
      "老獪で。",
      "……さらに言うなら、鬼婆と接触の深い人物。",
      "……祟りの前になると、接触の多くなる人物。",
      "富竹さんの怪しい死に方から、奇怪なクスリ、そして医療機関の関係者も連想された。",
      "…………入江診療所の所長。",
      "………監督？",
      "確かに、この過疎の村にあって、あれだけ立派な診療所を奉仕的な精神で開業してくれている監督は村の名士だった。",
      "成熟した性格も、村の老人たちから高く評価され、また一目置かれている。",
      "何しろ、医者の殺人鬼ほど怖いものはない。",
      "………監督が祟りの実行者だったなら、過去の不審な、奇怪な死に方のほとんどが説明できるかもしれない。",
      "だが、監督がＸである可能性は、多分ほとんどないだろうと思った。",
      "その致命的理由は、鬼婆が監督を信頼してなかったからだ。",
      "…鬼婆は年齢特有の若者嫌いがあって、若すぎる監督には心を開いてはいなかったことを、私は知っている。",
      "彼の公の場での挙動を、身内の前で堂々と非難、中傷していたことを私は知っている。",
      "監督はいくら名士とは言っても所詮は余所者。",
      "この土地に生まれた者ではない。",
      "村の大恩ある診療所長として、良好な関係を築きつつもそれは上辺だけ。",
      "……本当の悩みや、暗部を鬼婆が打ち明けたとはとても思えないのだ。",
      "鬼婆が、私並かそれ以上に疑い深い人間なら。",
      "……ダークサイドに関わる人間は、信頼のできる人間だけで固める。",
      "…真っ先に思いつくのは、その他の御三家の頭首たちだった。",
      "古手家頭首の梨花ちゃまはさて置き、公由家頭首の村長は確かに考えられる。",
      "園崎天皇に意見できる唯一の存在だ。",
      "歳が近いこともあり、御三家の会議などのきな臭い席を除けば、二人が気心の知れた親しい仲であることは誰もが知っている。",
      "しかも村長は、綿流しの時期が近付けば、運営のための打ち合わせと称して頻繁に園崎本家を訪れるようになる。",
      "二人が内密な話をしているところなど、自然に考えられる…。",
      "オヤシロさまの祟りの執行者。",
      "鷹野さんたちを惨殺した執行者。",
      "５年にも及ぶ雛見沢村連続怪死事件の暗躍者。",
      "その魔手は、…私にも伸びているのか。",
      "そして、……その魔手は悟史くんにも伸びたのか。",
      "…悟史くんのことを思った時。",
      "………私は不思議な高揚を感じた。",
      "さっきまで私は、自らが今年の犠牲者に含まれていることを恐れていた。",
      "その自分に迫る魔手を怖がっていた。",
      "だが、思い返してみれば。",
      "…その私に迫る魔手は、悟史くんの仇でもあるのだ。",
      "捜せども捜せども見つからず、",
      "……忘れかけてさえいた、仇の存在。",
      "それが、幸か不幸か、私の前に再び現れようとしている。",
      "求めども求めども見つからなかった、仇が。",
      "向こうから私の前に現れようとしているのだ。",
      "そう。",
      "……私は追われるだけの立場ではないのだ。",
      "追う者でもあったのだ。",
      "それを思い出した時。",
      "………５年目の祟りは、死の恐怖ではなく、…互いにとって互角な条件のゲームとなった。",
      "私は脅かされるだけの立場ではない。",
      "…同時に脅かす立場でもあったのだ。",
      "そう、今こそ悟史くんの無念を晴らす時。",
      "長い時間の間に、ぼやけてしまった感情を今こそ蘇らす時なのだ。",
      "自分の中に義憤と勇気が込み上げてくるのが分かる。",
      "…恐怖に打ち勝つ唯一の感情、それが怒りなのだから。",
      "その感情が完全に恐怖を塗りつぶした時。",

      "If Irie was the person behind the curse, all the mysterious deaths could be explained.",

      "The main reason being that the hag wouldn't trust him.",
      "Like many of the elderly, the hag doesn't like young people. I knew she'd never trust him, because of his age.",
      "Furthermore, she had openly criticized his behavior among the relatives once.",
      "Although Irie was famous, he was an outsider, after all.",
      "He wasn't born here.",
      "He tried to maintain a good relationship with the villagers as the director of the clinic, but that was just on the surface.",
      "I couldn't even imagine the hag telling him about her worries, or about the village's underside.",

      "He was the only one who could advise Empress Sonozaki.",
      "They were of a similar age, and everyone knew that they were very close outside the family councils.",
