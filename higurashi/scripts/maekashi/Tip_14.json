      "祭具殿の不可侵性は、オヤシロさま崇拝の中でも群を抜く。",
      "もちろんそれは私も、雛見沢に縁のある人間として知ってはいた。",
      "だが、実際は私が知る以上に、もっともっと偏執的なくらいの不可侵性があったのだ。",
      "鷹野さんの研究によるなら、祭具殿の不可侵性の歴史は相当古いという。",
      "それだけ祭具を使った奇祭「綿流し」が神聖視されていたことの証だろう。",
      "だが、鷹野さんの研究では綿流しは純粋な宗教儀式でなく、御三家の支配体制をより磐石にするための、公開処刑的な意味があったという。",
      "だとするなら、そもそも神聖視という呼び方が間違っている。",
      "そんな状況下でなら、憎悪と恐怖の対象として疎まれた存在のはず。",
      "恐怖は露見し過ぎればただの恐怖支配に過ぎない。",
      "だが、極力隠せば神聖さが宿る。",
      "俗人が触れると穢れがつくとよく言う。",
      "それは衆人環視に晒されたら威厳がなくなるので、もったいぶって隠した方が、箔がつく…という意味でしかないのだ。",
      "つまり、祭具殿の不可侵性の正体は、…恐怖。",
      "この村を支配する真の感情の正体なのだ……。"

      "The sanctity of the ritual storehouse is one of the most prominent elements in the worship of Oyashiro-sama.",
      "Of course, I knew that, since I'm originally from Hinamizawa.",
      "But violating that sanctity is actually a more serious problem than I thought.",
      "Takano-san's research shows that the history of the ritual storehouse goes way back.",
      "The ritual implements within have long been viewed as inviolable objects, which is why it was strictly forbidden to enter.",
      "Takano-san's theory says that Watanagashi was once a public execution, performed to stabilize the reign of the Three Families, rather than a purely religious ritual.",
      "If so, the ritual should hardly be called sacred.",
      "Under those circumstances, the implements should have been despised as symbols of hatred and fear.",
      "When instruments of fear are too visible, it only creates a reign of terror.",
      "But keep them as hidden as possible, and they gain divinity.",
      "Many said they would become tainted if the laymen touched them.",
      "The only reason for that was to preserve their false prestige through secrecy, since they would lose their sanctity if revealed before the common folk.",
      "In other words, the true identity of the ritual storehouse's sacredness... was fear.",
      "That was the true emotion ruling over this village..."
