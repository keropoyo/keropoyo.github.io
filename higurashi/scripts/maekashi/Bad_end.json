      "容疑者は６月１９日から２１日までの間に雛見沢村住民４人（園崎お魎・公由喜一郎・古手梨花・北条沙都子）を拉致、監禁して殺害した疑い。",
      "事件は当初、情報不足のため初動捜査で遅れをとったが、偶然的、電撃的に解決した。",
      "２２日午前中、園崎邸前を巡回していた警邏車両は邸内よりの悲鳴を聞き、緊急措置として邸内へ突入。",
      "失踪中の容疑者の姉（園崎魅音）とクラスメイト２名（竜宮礼奈・前原圭一）を保護した。",
      "",
      "ただし、先行して邸宅内にて説得を行っていたクラスメイト、前原圭一は容疑者の抵抗を受けて刺傷を負った模様。救急病院へと搬送されたが、軽傷との診断。",
      "容疑者とは直前まで最も会話交渉を行う機会が多かったものと見て、心労が回復次第、事情聴取を行う予定。",
      "",
      "なお、容疑者は前述の前原圭一が拘束されていた場所から離れること約２ｍの場所で、喉に擦過傷を負って倒れていたところを捕縛。こちらも救急病院へと搬送したが、２２日１３時４８分、死亡が確認された。",
      "司法解剖の結果、直接の死因は出血多量による出血性ショックであるとの診断。",
      "",
      "失踪者たちを殺害したと思われる園崎邸内の離れ地下奥、秘密部屋からは、失踪者４人（園崎お魎・公由喜一郎・古手梨花・北条沙都子）の毛髪、皮膚片、血液などを発見。",
      "秘密部屋内で失踪者たちが暴行を受けたものと断定した。",
      "その遺体は、保護された園崎魅音の証言により、古井戸の底から発見された。",
      "また、ほのめかしたとされる近年の連続怪死事件への関与も捜査が続けられているが、園崎詩音が直接、または間接的に関わったという証拠は発見されていない。",
      "",
      "事件の動機には今もなお不明な点が多く、また、園崎家、雛見沢村住民の極度の非協力もあり、その解明には膨大な時間を要することが予想される。",
      "地域に詳しい地元警察の見解では、雛見沢村内の信仰に対する冒涜行為を巡る、内部懲罰、リンチ事件ではないかと見ている。",
      "地域性に根ざした特殊な事件であることは間違いなく、県警本部は慎重な捜査を命じた。",
      "容疑者の妹で、もっとも監禁期間の長いと思われる失踪者（園崎魅音）から重要な手掛かりを得られるのではないかと期待したが、",
      "事件後に激しい精神的ショックを負ったものとみられ、心身の治癒のために事情聴取は一定期間見送る予定。",
      "主治医の診断では、重症ではあるものの回復の見込みがあるらしく、現在、友人たちの協力でリハビリ治療を行っている。",

      "…俺は病院で検査を受けながら、大石さんにあれこれと質問を受けた。",
      "とりあえずわかる範囲で答えてみたが、…それが彼の求めていたものだったかまではわからないし、その責任を負う義務もなかった。",
      "聞いた話では、…詩音は警察が突入した時には出血多量でもう、息をしていなかったらしい。",
      "急いで救急車を呼びつけて診療所に運び込んだが、手当てをする間もなく息を引き取ったそうだ…。",
      "不幸中の幸いとしては、牢に閉じ込められていた魅音が無事、警察に保護されたことだった。",
      "気を失う直前まで俺は、詩音が激情にかられて魅音を殺すのでは、と案じていたが、…最悪の結末を回避できたことだけは、素直に嬉しかった。",
      "ただ、…救出された時の魅音は激しい衰弱状態で、特に心には大きな傷を負ってしまっていた。",
      "…救出時は警察からの問いかけにも、全く応じることがなかったらしい。",
      "現在魅音は、心身の治療のため穀倉にある大きな病院に入院している。",
      "俺とレナで見舞いに行っても、最初の頃は俯いて、すっかりやつれて、…酷い有様だった。",
      "それでも最近は、ようやく少しだけ笑顔を見せてくれる程度には、元気を取り戻しつつある。",
      "もっとも、沙都子や梨花ちゃん、もちろん詩音のことは一切話題に上げたことがない…。",
      "警察は事件発生から数日にわたって、園崎家の地下祭具殿の現場検証を行った。",
      "特に、詩音が沙都子や梨花ちゃんの遺体を投げ捨てたと言っていた井戸は、県警の鑑識捜査員も含めて念入りに調査された結果、…詩音の証言通りに、『彼女たち』は発見された。",
      "井戸の底は泥が堆積していたため、発見には数日の時間を要したらしい。",
      "沙都子たちの他にも、明らかに数年、数十年は経過したと思われる白骨も見つかったそうだが、それに関しては俺の知るところではない。",
      "俺も、現場検証のために一度その場所に連れ戻されたが、特に何か重要なものを発見する助けにはならなかった…。",
      "自宅には連日、興宮の園崎家、つまり魅音と詩音の両親が大勢の子分を連れて、何度も謝罪にやってきた。",
      "そして両親がいくら断っても、毎日慰謝料と称して百万円単位の札束をいくつも積んでいく。",
      "その額が日々積み重なり、ある程度の額が貯まったある日、…今度はそこに、手紙の入った封筒も添えられていた。",
      "…その手紙に、何が書かれていたのか、わからない。",
      "ただ、両親は俺を抜きにして二晩も話し込み、…雛見沢から引越すことを、決めた。"

      "June, 1983.",
      "A case of serial disappearances occurred in Hinamizawa Village, Shishibone City, XX Prefecture.",
      "The suspect is Shion Sonozaki (1X years old).",
      "Allegedly, she abducted five Hinamizawan residents (Oryou Sonozaki, Shion Sonozaki, Kiichirou Kimiyoshi, Rika Furude, and Satoko Houjou) and imprisoned them from June 19th through the 21st.",
      "Preliminary investigation into the incident was delayed at the time due to insufficient evidence, but by chance, the case was solved rather abruptly.",
      "On the morning of the 22nd, a patrol vehicle stationed outside the Sonozaki mansion heard screams from within, and personnel infiltrated the premises as an emergency measure.",
      "The suspect's missing elder sister (Mion Sonozaki) and two of her classmates (Keiichi Maebara and Reina Ryuugu) were taken into custody.",
      "<size=-2>",
      "However, Keiichi Maebara who had previously been lured into the crime scene had sustained stab wounds perpetrated by the suspect. He was immediately transferred to an emergency unit, but they were diagnosed as a minor injury.",
      "Having been the one with the utmost opportunity to engage in conversation with the suspect until the very end, he will be subject to interrogation once he has recovered from the shock.",
      "<size=-4>",
      "Furthermore, the apprehended suspect was found collapsed at a place approximately 2 meters away from where Keiichi Maebara was restrained, and sustained scratch wounds on her throat. She was also transferred to an emergency facility, but was pronounced dead at 13:48 on the 22nd.",
      "The official autopsy determines that the immediate cause of death was hemorrhagic shock due to excessive blood loss.",
      "<size=-4>",
      "Hair, pieces of skin, and blood of the four missing people (Oryou Sonozaki, Kiichirou Kimiyoshi, Rika Furude, and Satoko Houjou) were recovered from the hidden chamber that was discovered in the outbuilding basement of the Sonozaki family property, where they were supposedly killed.",
      "It was concluded that the victims were assaulted in that hidden chamber.",
      "The victims' bodies were discovered at the bottom of an old well, as per the testimony of the victim, Mion Sonozaki",
      "In addition, investigations continue into any possible connection to the Series of Mysterious Deaths in recent years, but no evidence of Shion Sonozaki's direct or indirect involvement has been found.",
      "<size=-2>",
      "There are still many obscurities to the motive behind the incident, and due to extreme non-cooperation from the Sonozaki family and residents of Hinamizawa, a large amount of time will be required to clarify matters on this front.",
      "The local police who are familiar with the region offer that this may have been an internal lynching incident, as punishment for sacrilegious acts carried out against Hinamizawa's religious beliefs.",
      "It has been established that the incident is unique and rooted in the regional community beliefs, and a cautious investigation has been ordered by the prefectural police.",
      "We expected to gain valuable hints from the missing person and the suspect's sister, Mion Sonozaki, who was under confinement for the longest time period,",
      "but it was observed that she had sustained severe mental trauma from the incident, and her inquiry has been postponed in favor of her psychological and physical recovery.",
      "According to her primary care physician, although her condition is fairly serious, there is a strong prospect of recovery, and she is at present undergoing rehabilitation with support from her close friends.",
      "... Several weeks have passed since then.",
      "After that incident, I was rescued by Ooishi-san and his team whom Rena had summoned.",
      "I had no other after-effects aside from my consciousness that had been wiped white.",
      "If I were to have any at all... it would have to be the deep scars that had been left inside my heart.",
      "As I was being examined at the hospital, I was subjected to various queries from Ooishi-san.",
      "I tried to answer him with whatever little I knew... but I had no idea if it met his expectations and neither did I bear any responsibility to do so.",
      "From what I had heard, Shion had already lost too much blood by the time the had police arrived... and she had stopped breathing.",
      "They urgently called for an ambulance and took her to the clinic, but there was barely any time for first aid and she took her last breath...",
      "The silver lining was that Mion who had been captive in her cell, was safe, and taken into custody by the police.",
      "Up until the moment I lost consciousness, I was afraid that Shion may fly into a rage and murder Mion... but I was just glad we had managed to avoid the worst-case scenario.",
      "Only... when Mion was rescued, she was emaciated and had sustained severe psychological trauma.",
      "...Apparently at the time of her rescue, she had been completely unable to respond to the police's questions.",
      "Right now, Mion is admitted at a large hospital in the vicinity and undergoing treatment for her psychological and physical injuries.",
      "In the beginning, when Rena and I went to visit, her eyes were downcast in desolation and she looked completely worn out... it was a horrible state to be in.",
      "But despite it all, as of late, she is on her way to recovery... finally well enough to show us a few smiles.",
      "Of course, we have been careful to not bring up Satoko or Rika-chan, and especially Shion...",
      "The police later conducted an on-site investigation at the Sonozaki House's underground storehouse, several days after the incident took place.",
      "Particularly, the well inside which Satoko and Rika-chan's bodies were disposed of by Shion was carefully surveyed by the prefectural forensic investigators... and true to Shion's testimony, 'the girls' were discovered.",
      "Apparently, sediment had accumulated at the bottom of the well, and hence the discovery had taken several days.",
      "Along with Satoko and the other victims, skeletal remains that were several years, even several decades old were found, but it's not like I would know much about that.",
      "Even I was once summoned back to that place to assist with the crime scene investigation, but I didn't really help them find anything important...",
      "The Sonozaki Family in Okinomiya, in other words, Mion and Shion's parents, came home everyday several times along with many of their followers to formally apologize.",
      "And no matter how much my parents refused, they kept piling up bank notes worth millions of yen as compensation.",
      "And once that money had piled up and reached a certain amount... on the same day, there came an envelope with a letter instead.",
      "I have no idea what was written in that letter.",
      "But, my parents had discussed amongst themselves for two nights straight without consulting me... and decided we would move away from Hinamizawa."
