      "「起」を起こさない究極は、…死体を発見されないこと。",
      "殺す以上に、重要な要素だ。",
      "漠然と考えて、…一番最初に思いついたのは、沼だった。",
      "……鬼ヶ淵村の伝説に登場し、…今でも崇められ、恐れられている底無し沼、鬼ヶ淵。",
      "そう、鬼ヶ淵という沼がまず先にあり、…そこから村の名前が鬼ヶ淵沼になったのだ。",
      "……この沼こそ、…鬼ヶ淵村の原点。",
      "底無しの沼で、沈めば何人たりとも浮かび上がることはできず…みな地の底の鬼の国に飲み込まれていくのみ。",
      "…そう伝えられる。",
      "オヤシロさまの祟りを模倣しようとしているなら、この沼に遺体や凶器を投棄するのはセオリーのようにも感じられる。",
      "だが……底無し沼と言ったって、実際はどうかなんてわからない。",
      "それに、人間のような大きな生き物は、腐ると大量のガスが発生して、強力な浮力で浮き上がってしまうという。",
      "多少の重りなんかじゃ沈めておけないという話だ。",
      "……そう言えば、おととしの祟りで、梨花ちゃんの母親はこの沼に入水自殺したそうだな。",
      "…一番最初の祟りで失踪したバラバラ殺人犯も、この沼に死体を捨てようとして誤って溺れてしまったと噂されている。",
      "…その死体が浮いたとか、見つかったという話は聞かない。",
      "………ならば、…俺も死体をここに捨てるのを選ぶべきでは………。",
      "……………………………凶器の投棄はここでもいいだろう。",
      "…あと、……例えば、叔父がバイクで外出中に襲撃した場合、…そのバイクを捨てるのもここが都合がいい。",
      "（沙都子の叔父の足が、基本的にバイクであることはわかってる）",
      "でも…死体は……………。",
      "悩んだ末、…俺は死体を沼に捨てることを選ばないことにする。",
      "…入水自殺も溺死も、どちらも噂で…実際にあったのを誰か確認したわけじゃない。",
      "入水自殺だって偽装の噂が少なからずあるし、殺人犯だって溺れたりせず、今日までどこかで逃げ延びている可能性がある。",
      "………つまり、…この沼に死体を捨てて、浮かないことを確認した者はいないのだ。",
      "では、死体をどうする…？",
      "第一の事件に習い、バラバラにして隠すのも面白いかと思ったが、…人間を解体する苦労と準備、時間は俺個人にはなかなか難しい。",
      "……そうして突き詰めていくと…オーソドックスに、…穴に埋めるのがいいという結論に至る。",
      "ではどこに埋めるのか、…という話になると今度は、どこで殺すのかという問題が関わってくる。",
      "当り前だが、死体と共にする時間と距離は最小限が望ましい。",
      "その意味では、死体処理用の穴は予め掘ってあった方がいいし、犯行予定地と死体処理用の穴は近い方がいい。",
      "…犯行予定地の選定も、……慎重かつ万全を期さなければならない。",
      "誰にも目撃されることがなく、…奇襲できるような隠れられる場所があって。",
      "…すぐ近くに死体処理の穴が掘ることができる。",
      "……沙都子の家から、叔父が出掛けるだろう様々な行き先の可能性を網羅する。",
      "その周辺の地図を脳内に再現した時、……信じられないくらいにあっさりと条件を満たす場所が見つけられた。",
      "…………林の中を抜ける、ちょっとした裏道。",
      "叔父が、何かの気まぐれで、谷河内の山奥に行こうなんて思わない限り、……どこへ行こうとしてもまず、この林を抜ける……。",
      "また、この裏道は、沙都子の家とその並びの何件かしか使わない。",
      "…この道の利用者は理想的なくらいに…少数なのだ。",
      "この林の中で、…待ち受ける。",
      "…実際に待ち伏せは可能か。",
      "木立の中に入り、実際に身を隠しいろいろと試す。",
      "……非常に静か。",
      "…気配を最大限に研ぎ澄ませることができる。",
      "ここで、…いつ訪れるかわからない、沙都子の叔父を待つ。",
      "………実はこれには多少の迷いがあった。",
      "…何らかの方法で誘き寄せるべきではないかという疑問。",
      "…誘き寄せることによって残るかもしれない、何かのリスク。",
      "…あの男は、買い物や雑用は全て沙都子にやらせる。",
      "……自ら外へ出る用事は、多くない。",
      "……何かの策を講じなければ、…外出しないのではないか。",
      "…そういう疑問。",
      "明日は綿流しのお祭りだ。",
      "……あいつは、綿流しには出掛けるのか、出掛けないのか。",
      "出掛けない場合、…いかにして家から引きずり出すのか。",
      "…そうだ。",
      "…………あいつ、…沙都子は祭りに行かせるだろうか。",
      "沙都子が祭りに行く。",
      "……その間にあの男に電話する。",
      "…こちらは興宮警察署です。",
      "お宅のお嬢さんを保護しましたので、ただちに引き取りに来てもらえませんか。",
      "…別に警察でなくてもいい。",
      "診療所です、御宅のお嬢さんが怪我をしました。",
      "迎えに来てください、でも構わない。",
      "…警察とか病院とか、そういうところを名乗り、来いとだけ告げて一方的に電話を切れば、…状況を知るためにもまずは飛んで来るのでは。",
      "それにあいつはつい先日、保護司の訪問を受けたばかりだ。",
      "…ここでいきなり娘の引き取りを面倒臭がって、「育児放棄」なんて真似をするはずがない。",
      "……あの生活力ゼロの男には、…沙都子という奴隷は日々の生活に不可欠な存在でもあるからだ。",
      "結論。",
      "……祭りに出掛けるなら、…その行きか帰りをここで襲う。",
      "出掛けないなら、…電話でやつを誘き出す。",
      "電話で誘き出す前段階として、沙都子が確実に祭りに出掛けて、家を留守にしなくてはならない。",
      "…沙都子を祭りに連れて行くのは、魅音にやらせると都合がいい。",
      "…あいつの叔母が確か民生委員だとか言ってた。",
      "…つまり保護司の仲間だ。",
      "…魅音に、何としてでも沙都子を祭りに連れて行けと焚きつければ、…あいつのことだ、その辺りをうまく使って、沙都子を祭りに連れて行けるはず…。",
      "……沙都子は、息抜きのつもりで…みんなと祭りで遊んでいればいい。",
      "…楽しく遊んで、平穏だった日々を懐かしみ…帰る頃には全てが終わっている。",
      "…あぁ、…それが一番いい。",
      "そうと決まれば…、この林のどこかに死体を隠すための穴を掘らなければならない。",
      "……目立たず見つからず。",
      "…死体を埋めるという無防備時間の間、絶対に誰にも見つからない場所。",
      "…犯行現場の近くのつもりが、…自然に遠のいてしまう。",
      "真っ暗な深き森の懐。",
      "……ひぐらしの声だけが響き、人が軽々しく踏み込むべきところでないことを知らせている。"

      "...Disposing of the corpse.",
      "The ultimate way not to create a \"beginning\"... was to not let the corpse be found.",
      "It was even more important than killing him.",
      "Thinking on it vaguely... the first thing that came to mind was the swamp.",
      "...Onigafuchi, the dreadful bottomless swamp revered even now... that appeared in the legends of Onigafuchi Village.",
      "Yes, the swamp called Onigafuchi was here first... and then the village took its name to become Onigafuchi Village.",
      "...In other words, this swamp... was the origin of Onigafuchi Village.",
      "No one, no matter who it was, would float back to the surface of this bottomless swamp... Everyone would be swallowed down into the land of the demons below the earth.",
      "...That was how the stories went.",
      "If I was trying to copy Oyashiro-sama's curse, then I felt that theory demanded I discard the remains and the weapon into the swamp.",
      "But... They may have said it's bottomless, but I didn't actually know.",
      "And people say large creatures like humans produce a lot of gas when they rot, granting a lot of buoyancy.",
      "It was why using fairly heavy objects to hold people down didn't work.",
      "...Come to think of it, with the curse the year before last, Rika-chan's mother drowned herself in this swamp.",
      "...And the criminal behind the dismemberment that went missing the year of the first curse too—it was rumored he'd tried to discard the body in the swamp and accidentally drowned in it.",
      "...I never heard of the corpse coming back up or them finding it.",
      "...Then... shouldn't I choose to discard the corpse there, too...?",
      "............I could discard the weapon there.",
      "...And then... for example, if her uncle came out on a motorcycle and attacked... it would be convenient to get rid of the bike, too.",
      "(I knew that Satoko's uncle generally used a motorcycle for transportation.)",
      "But... as for the corpse......",
      "After a lot of worrying... I decided not to discard the corpse in the swamp.",
      "...The drowning suicide and accident were both rumors... Nobody knew if they'd actually happened.",
      "There were no lack of false rumors about the drowning suicide anyway, and it was possible the murderer hadn't drowned there and was still on the run.",
      "...That meant... no one had ever confirmed a corpse being dropped in there and then not coming back up.",
      "Then what would I do with the body...?",
      "I thought it might be interesting to go with the first incident, cut him to pieces and hide him... but the preparation and work for dismembering a human body would be difficult given the amount of time I had.",
      "...With that out of the question... I arrived at the conclusion... to go with the more orthodox method of burying the body.",
      "Then where I would bury it... was a question related to where I would kill him.",
      "Of course, I wanted to keep my time in proximity to the body at a minimum.",
      "With that in mind, I would want to dig the hole to dump the body in beforehand, and to make the location of the act and the hole close together.",
      "...The choice of where to plan the crime... That, I needed to be absolutely careful and thorough with.",
      "It had to be somewhere nobody would witness it... and a place with hiding places for a sneak attack.",
      "...I could dig a hole for the body right there.",
      "...I go over the possibilities in my head of the various destinations her uncle would head to from Satoko's house.",
      "I imagined a map of the area in my head... and then I found a place that fulfilled those conditions so easily it was almost unbelievable.",
      "......A bit of a back road that went through the woods.",
      "I didn't think her uncle would go deeper into the mountains of Yagouchi on a whim... If he was going somewhere, he'd pass through these woods first...",
      "And nobody used this back way unless they had something to do at Satoko's house or one or two other places.",
      "...This path was fantastically ideal... as few people used it.",
      "I would wait for him... in these woods.",
      "...Would an ambush actually be possible?",
      "I went into the trees and tried really hiding myself in a few places.",
      "...It was extremely quiet.",
      "...My senses could be sharpened here to their maximum amount.",
      "I didn't know when he'd come... but I'd wait right here... for Satoko's uncle.",
      "......I actually had some trouble coming to that decision.",
      "The question arose of whether I should somehow call the man out.",
      "...Was there a risk I'd be taking by luring him here?",
      "...That man made Satoko do all the shopping and errands.",
      "...He seldom left on his own business.",
      "...He wouldn't leave... unless I worked out a plan to force him to, would he?",
      "...That was the question.",
      "Tomorrow was the Watanagashi Festival.",
      "...Would he go out for the festival or would he stay inside?",
      "If he stayed inside... how would I drag him out of his house?",
      "...That's right.",
      "......Wouldn't he... make Satoko go to the festival?",
      "Satoko would go to the festival.",
      "...Meanwhile, I would call the man.",
      "...This is the Okinomiya police station.",
      "We have the young lady from your house—could you come and pick her up immediately?",
      "...It didn't even have to be the police.",
      "This is the clinic—the young lady from your house has been injured.",
      "Please come and pick her up—yes, that would work too.",
      "...If I claimed to be the police or the hospital, told him to come and then hung up on him... He'd rush there trying to figure out what was going on, wouldn't he?",
      "And just the other day, he was visited by a probation officer.",
      "...He wouldn't suddenly grumble about having to get his niece and not go—it would look like child neglect.",
      "...The man had no skills useful around the house... Satoko, his slave, was an essential part of his daily life.",
      "Conclusion.",
      "...If he went out to the festival... I would attack him here on his way there or back.",
      "If he didn't... I would lure him out by phone.",
      "If luring him out by phone was my first step, I needed to be sure Satoko would go to the festival, leaving the house.",
      "...It would be convenient if I could make Mion take Satoko to the festival.",
      "...She said her aunt was a district welfare officer.",
      "...In other words, an ally to the probation officer.",
      "...If I somehow incited Mion to take Satoko to the festival with her... Well, being who she was, she'd use that fact and get her there...",
      "...Satoko should just... take a break and have fun at the festival with everyone.",
      "...She should have a good time, reminisce on our former, peaceful days... and when she went home, everything would be over.",
      "...Yeah... That would be the best outcome.",
      "With that decided... I needed to dig a hole somewhere in the woods to hide the body.",
      "...So it wouldn't stand out, so it wouldn't be found.",
      "...Some place nobody would see me while I was completely exposed as I buried the corpse.",
      "...I had wanted it to be close to the scene of the crime... but it naturally grew farther away.",
      "Deep in the bosom of the black forest.",
      "...The voices of the higurashi were the only sounds here, informing me that people shouldn't indiscreetly set foot in this place."
