      "もちろん考える議題は、…沙都子についてだ。",

      "………事態は簡単ではない。",
      "でも、俺はさっき監督の前ではっきり宣言した。",
      "…沙都子が危ないと思ったら、…俺は俺の独自の判断で行動する、と。",
      "結局は俺も様子見な訳だが…。",
      "…それでも、仲間や監督よりも一線を画していると思った。",
      "…いざという時は、…俺が通報しよう。",
      "電話で。",
      "………俺が通報したことがわかれば、沙都子の性格からして、俺を非難するかもしれない。",
      "…でも、…最終的にはそれが良い判断になると信じる。",

      "…通報するだけでもう問題は終わりか…？",

      "…去年、様子見ということになり、一時的に状況は改善したが、…叔母は恥をかかされたと思いいじめを水面下へ移行。",

      "今年は叔父だ。",
      "…………今日、初めてその顔を見たが、…陰湿という言葉よりはもっともっと直接的な、暴力的という表現が似合う男だった。",
      "…叔母のように陰湿な、…なんて甘いものじゃなく、…もっと直接的に…。",
      "殴る蹴るの暴行を加えるかもしれない。",
      "…それは、沙都子の体にいくつか見られたアザ等から容易に推察できるものだ。",

      "頭をガリガリガリっと掻き、ほんのわずかの冷静さが欲しくて、頭を後ろにそらす。",
      "…………………今日の仲間たちとの、怒鳴りあいが思い出されくる。",
      "レナに言われるまで気付けなかったことを恥じる。",
      "…そう。",
      "……俺の家は大きい。",
      "…雛見沢の、わらぶき屋根の家々に比べれば、…ずっと大きい。",

      "…客室なんか、たまに来る仕事関係の人を泊める以外はただの空き部屋じゃないか。",
      "…親父が物置にしてる部屋のいくつかだって、ちゃんと片付ければ充分な部屋になる。",
      "………食費の問題は、…子供の俺が考えるよりは、切実な厳しい問題かもしれない。",
      "昼の弁当は何とかなるだろ。",
      "…仲間みんなで、これからはほんの少し多めに弁当を用意すればいい。",
      "みんなで突付きあうんだから、何とかなる。",
      "…だが、…朝、夜の食事は…お袋の世話にならざるを得ない。",

      "本当はもっとお年玉とかが溜まってるのだが、…それらは全部親に没収されて定期預金に入れられてしまっている。",
      "……それを取り崩せば、結構まとまったお金になるはず。",

      "……人の無駄にやたらと厳しい几帳面な母が、こういう時だけ煩わしい。",
      "…沙都子が自分の衣服の洗濯に使う洗剤の代金とか…そういうものにまで言及があるかもしれない。",
      "…食費だけじゃ駄目なんだ。",
      "もっと…お金がいる。",
      "（おいおい前原圭一、いつの間にお金さえあれば何とかなるって論法になったんだ？！",

      "たかだか…焼き魚の皿をひとつ持ち出そうとして…二人掛りかよ？！",
      "親の目を盗んで食事を持ち出すなんて…実際には無理だ。",
      "…でもきっと…考える価値はあるぞ。",
      "…手品みたいな、あるいは死角的な手法で、うまく目を誤魔化す方法がきっとある…。",
      "（例えそれが今日思いつかなくても、明日思いつくかもしれないわけだし…！）",
      "食欲も徐々になくなり、早々とごちそうさまをして俺は自室へ戻った。",
      "…戻り、…沙都子の身になって考えることにした。",
      "……例えば、今、親が階段を登ってきたとする。さぁ隠れろ…！",
      "押入れをあける。",
      "……ガタガタ。",
      "…静かに開かない。",
      "おいおい…、いつもは静かにすーっと開くじゃないか？！",
      "何で今頃になって急に！",
      "欠陥住宅かよ？！",
      "もう家にガタが来たのか？！",
      "それともロウでも足りなくなんたのか？！",
      "ワックスでも塗ればいいのかッ？！",
      "…音としてはわずかかもしれないが、…階段を上がってきた親に気配を察知させないという意味では不安が残る。",
      "……でもこのくらいは何とかなる問題だ。",
      "音がしなくなるように、ちょっと俺が改造するなりの工夫をすればいいだけだ。",
      "とりあえず…隠れるのに成功したとして押入れに篭ってみよう。",
      "………基本的に布団はいつも出しっ放し。",
      "押入れを親が開ける理由はあまり思いつかない。",
      "…それでも、何かの理由で開けることがあるかもしれない。",
      "仮に開けられても、気付かれないようなカモフラージュや改造が必要かもしれない。",
      "でも、そんなものに凝れば凝るほど、…沙都子が隠れるための時間は足りなくなり、音で気配を察知させてしまう可能性は高くなる…。",
      "…………その時、………トイレに行きたくなった。",
      "…トイレ……？！",
      "こんな当り前の排泄行為が……実は致命的だったのだ…。",
      "トイレは一階にしかない。",
      "トイレを家人に気付かせずに使用するなんて絶対に無理だ。",
      "……俺の部屋で済ませられるように、携帯便所（まぬけに言うならおまるとかのことだ。",
      "…沙都子は嫌がるだろうな）の準備がいるかもしれない。",
      "…でも、…糞尿の臭いって、……結構きつい。",
      "多分、敏感ならこの部屋に入らなくても異臭に気付く。",
      "……風呂はまだいいさ。",
      "家族の不在の隙を突くこともできる。",
      "でも、トイレだけはどうにもならない。",
      "…おなかが痛くなったとき、両親が一階をうろちょろしていたら…どうにもならない…！",
      "……この頃には…いつの間にか、両手が頭に爪を立てていた。",
      "真っ暗な押入れの中で、膝を立てて座り。",
      "……顔を膝に埋め、両手で頭を掻き毟る。",
      "…考えれば考えるほどに、矛盾が出る。",
      "…考えれば考えるほど破綻し、",
      "…悩めば悩むほどに………自分の無力さを思い出させられるのだ。",
      "窮屈なところにずっといたので、だんだん背骨が痛くなってきた。",
      "でもその痛みは、俺が沙都子をかくまったなら、強いねばならない痛みなのだ。",
      "…こんな暗くて狭くて、…息苦しい場所での生活を…ずっと。",
      "それでも、叔父の下で虐められている生活よりはずっとマシだと、…思いたい。",
      "……息苦しくなり、…俺はとうとう根を上げ、押入れから這い出た。",
      "時計を見ると……なんと、もう午前３時半。",
      "……信じられないくらいに時間の経過が早かった。",
      "それを認めると、わざわざ時間に合わせるかのように、強烈な眠気が襲ってきた。",
      "その抗いがたい力に負け、…布団の上にばったりと倒れこむ。",
      "…くそ、このまま寝ちゃうわけには行かないぞ。",
      "……俺が無駄に時間を過ごせば、それは結局、様子見を選んだ魅音たちや監督とまったく同じことになってしまうのだ。",
      "俺は…他の誰よりも、一分一秒でも悩み、考え、…沙都子を救い出すための方法を考えなくてはならない…。",
      "………何かいい方法はないか。",
      "…何かいい方法はないか。",
      "…そんな独り言だけが、螺旋のようにぐるぐると渦を巻き、……次第に俺の意識を飲み込んでいった………。",
      "意識を失う最後の一瞬、考える。",
      "……俺が今夜考えたことは確かに盲点の多いものだったが、…発想は決して悪くなかった。",
      "……明日、この大胆な策をみんなに提案してみよう。",
      "……魅音にも出来る協力があるかもしれないし、意外に鋭いレナがいい提案をしてくれるかもしれない。",
      "………そして何よりも。",
      "…みんなで協力して、……沙都子を救うことを再確認しなくてはならないのだ……。",
      "………………………………眠りの誘いに負ける自分が情けない。",
      "………すまん、…沙都子…。"

      "I only... tried to take away one plate of fish... and they ganged up on me?!",
      "In reality... it was impossible for me to smuggle food away without my parents knowing about it.",

      "(Even if I can't think of one today, I might think of one tomorrow...!)",
      "My appetite was rapidly fading, so I finished early and went back to my room.",
      "...I went back there... and tried to think about it from Satoko's point of view.",
      "...For example, let's say my parents were coming up the stairs right now. I've got to hide...!",
      "I opened the closet.",
      "...Clatter clatter.",
      "...It didn't open quietly.",
      "Hey, wait... Didn't it always open real smooth and quiet?!",

      "Or was I just not putting enough work into it?!",
      "Could I just plaster it with wax?!",

      "...But this was an easy problem—I could do something about it.",
      "I just had to fix it up a little bit so it didn't make noise anymore.",
      "For now... I'll close myself in the closet as though I'd successfully hid.",
      "......I basically always left my futon out on the floor.",
      "I couldn't think of any real reason my parents would want to go into my closet.",
      "...Even so, there still might be some reason they would.",
      "I might need to construct some sort of camouflage so that she wouldn't be noticed even if they did open it.",
      "But the more she worried about that... the less time she'd have to actually hide, meaning it would be more likely they'd hear a noise...",
      "...And then... I suddenly had to go to the bathroom.",
      "...The bathroom...?!",
      "The need to use the toilet—so obvious, and yet such a fatal flaw...",
      "The only bathroom was on the first floor.",
      "It would be absolutely impossible for her to use it without my family realizing.",
      "...I might need to set up a portable toilet (like a chamber pot, I guess...",
      "Satoko would hate it) so she could go in my room.",
      "...But... the stench... would be pretty terrible.",
      "Anyone sensitive would probably notice the smell without even coming into the room.",
      "...The bath was okay, though.",
      "She could just take a bath when my parents were out.",
      "But I couldn't do anything about a toilet.",

      "And the more I worried... the more I was reminded of how little power I actually had.",
      "My back started to hurt from staying in a cramped place for so long.",
      "But if I was to shelter Satoko, I would need to force her to feel this pain.",
      "...To live in such a dark, narrow... suffocating place... forever.",
      "But it would still be better than being abused by her uncle... or so I wanted to think.",
      "...It got hard to breathe... so I gave in and crawled out of the closet.",
      "I looked at the clock... and to my surprise, it was 3:30 in the morning.",
      "...It had felt like so little time, but it was so unbelievably long.",
      "When I realized that, I was slammed with a terrible urge to sleep as if the time had only just caught up with me.",
      "I didn't have enough strength to fight it... and I fell flat onto my futon.",
      "...Shit, I can't just go to sleep like this.",
      "...If I waste any time, that'll mean I'm taking the same 'wait and see' attitude that Mion and Coach and everyone else did.",

      "...Tomorrow, I would suggest this bold plan to the others.",
      "...Mion might be able to help somehow, and Rena was really sharp, so she might have a good suggestion.",
      "...And above all...",
