      "＜生贄の儀式について＞",
      "生贄の儀式は、最もシンプルな溺死型で、神聖な沼である鬼ヶ淵沼に犠牲者を沈めることで成立した。",
      "鬼ヶ淵村における儀式で特徴的なのは、犠牲者を三日三晩もの長い時間をかけてゆっくりと沈める点にある。",
      "犠牲者を沈めて「殺す」ことよりも、",
      "「沈める（鎮める）」行為に重きが置かれていたと考えられる。",
      "その為、放って置けばあっという間に沈んでしまう犠牲者をいかに緩慢に沈めるかに、様々な工夫が凝らされたはずである。",
      "残念だが、その方法は知る限りの文献には載せられていない。",
      "私の想像では、丸太等で巨大なイカダを組み、",
      "そこに処刑台を設え、縄で犠牲者を吊り上げ、時の刻みに合わせて少しずつ沼へ沈めていったのではないかと思う。",
      "だがそうだとするのならば、その儀式に使った「祭具」は神聖なものとして崇められ、どこかに祀られていてもおかしくない。"

      "<The Human Sacrifice Ritual>",
      "The sacrificial ritual was a simple drowning, involving plunging sacrifices into Onigafuchi Swamp, which was considered hallowed.",
      "Of the rituals of Onigafuchi Village, this one was unique in that the sacrifice would sink slowly over the long course of three days and three nights.",
      "I believe that it wasn't so much the killing of this sacrifice that was important,",
      "but rather the symbolism of them sinking as the 'submerging' of Oyashiro-sama's anger.",
      "For that purpose, they must have had a passion for learning various methods for keeping the sacrifice from sinking too quickly—to force them to sink more slowly.",
      "Unfortunately, as far as I can tell from the records, those methods were not recorded.",
      "My thoughts are that they may have used logs or some similar material to create a raft,",
      "then set up a scaffold on there, hung the sacrifice up with ropes, and let them sink little by little over time into the swamp.",
      "However, if that were the case, it would not be strange if the 'ritual implements' used for such a ceremony were honored as holy and enshrined somewhere."
