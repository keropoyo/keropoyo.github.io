      "事件は当初、情報不足のため初動捜査で遅れをとったが、偶然的、電撃的に解決した。",
      "２３日午前中、園崎邸前を巡回していた警邏車両は邸内よりの悲鳴を聞き、緊急措置として邸内へ突入。",

      "事件の動機には今もなお不明な点が多く、また、園崎家、雛見沢村住民の極度の非協力もあり、その解明には膨大な時間を要することが予想される。",
      "地域に詳しい地元警察の見解では、雛見沢村内の信仰に対する冒涜行為を巡る、内部懲罰、リンチ事件ではないかと見ている。",
      "地域性に根ざした特殊な事件であることは間違いなく、県警本部は慎重な捜査を命じた。",
      "容疑者の妹で、もっとも監禁期間の長いと思われる失踪者（園崎詩音）から重要な手掛かりを得られるのではないかと期待したが、",

      "June, 1983.",
      "A string of disappearances occurred in Hinamizawa Village, Shishibone City, ＸＸ Prefecture.",
      "The suspect is Mion Sonozaki (1X years old).",
      "<size=-2>",
      "She is suspected to have kidnapped five Hinamizawa residents between June 19 and June 21 (Oryou Sonozaki, Shion Sonozaki, Kiichirou Kimiyoshi, Rika Furude, and Satoko Houjou), imprisoned them, and killed them.",
      "Preliminary investigations on the incident were delayed at the time due to insufficient evidence, but it was resolved coincidentally and shockingly.",
      "On the morning of the 23rd, a vehicle patrolling the Sonozaki property heard screams from inside and rushed in as an emergency measure.",
      "They secured the suspect's missing younger sister (Shion Sonozaki) and her two missing classmates (Keiichi Maebara and Rena Ryuugu).",
      "The suspect fled the scene.",
      "<size=-2>",
      "Deep in the detached basement on the Sonozaki property, which is believed to have been used to kill those who disappeared, we discovered hair, flakes of skin, blood, etc. of the other four missing persons (Oryou Sonozaki, Kiichirou Kimiyoshi, Rika Furude, and Satoko Houjou).",
      "We concluded that the missing persons were tortured in the torture chamber.",
      "However, their remains have still not been found.",
      "<size=-2>",
      "At one of her imprisoned classmates' advice, we continued searching the detached basement of the Sonozaki property, which was where they were imprisoned, believing that they were there; however, we still have not located them or the suspect's escape route.",
      "In addition, investigations are continuing as to her participation in the serial freak death incidents of recent years, thinking it would give some clue...",
      "...but no evidence that Mion Sonozaki was involved, either directly or indirectly, has been found.",
      "<size=-2>",
      "There are still many unclear points as to the motive behind the incident, and as those of the Sonozaki family and the residents of Hinamizawa have been extremely uncooperative in assisting us, we expect to require a long time to clarify them.",
      "The opinion of a local officer knowledgeable about the region is that this may have been a lynching—an internal form of punishing sacrilegious acts carried out against the beliefs of Hinamizawa Village.",
      "It is clear that these incidents are particularly rooted in this region, and the prefectural police department has ordered a cautious investigation.",
      "We anticipated gaining valuable clues from the missing person believed to have been imprisoned for the longest time, Shion Sonozaki—the suspect's younger sister...",
      "...but her mind was stricken by the grave aftereffects of the incident, and she has not been in a state of mind to properly answer any questions about what she knows.",
      "The psychiatrist concluded that she is in a temporary state of shock, but it doesn't seem hopeful that she will recover today either.",
      "...............Only a few days...",
      "passed since that time.",
      "After that, I was rescued by Ooishi-san and his subordinates, whom Rena had called in.",
      "Aside from my entirely blank state of mind, I had no external injuries.",
      "The most I had was the small burn mark from where the stun gun hit me.",
      "...As I was having a check-up in the hospital... Ooishi-san asked me all sorts of things...",
      "but I don't really remember what he asked, or how I answered him.",
      "From what I heard... surprisingly, Mion still hadn't been captured.",
      "There were apparently a great many hallways and smaller rooms extending out from the depths of the prison.",
      "...It wouldn't be strange if she had fled to one of those and hidden herself.",
      "The one fortunate aspect amidst all the misfortune... was that Shion had been safely secured by the police.",
      "When I last saw Mion... she seemed like she was going to take me with her and then kill me...",
      "...She probably didn't have enough time to, though, since Ooishi-san came running in faster than she predicted.",
      "...That... was the only really fortunate thing to have happened.",
      "Of course... the rescued Shion...... despite having no external wounds... now had a big, deep wound in her heart.",
      "...She was in a severe state of confusion when they rescued her, and apparently she bit the police officers trying to resist.",
      "From what he heard, she was seeing Mion in everyone she saw,",
      "hated not only the hospital, but even her own home,",
      "and had shut herself up somewhere in Shishibone, hiding her location...",
      "...Additionally, in fear that Mion would come for her, she was moving from place to place every day, and even her parents weren't sure where she actually was.",
      "Wherever she was living... even now, Shion was spending her days in fear of Mion's shadow...",
      "The police were investigating the Sonozaki's underground storehouse at this moment.",
      "Since... they couldn't find the remains of the other sacrifices.",
      "...Hadn't Mion...",
      "thrown the corpses into a well...?",
      "I had a feeling I'd said that to him.",
      "That meant a hidden tunnel, vertical like a well, was somewhere in those underground passages.",
      "The secret underground, without any maps or architectural drawings...",
      "which had swallowed up the remains of Rika-chan, Satoko,",
      "and everyone else... was still unwilling to speak the truth...",
      "I was brought back to that basement again too, for an on-the-site inspection or something...",
      "but I didn't remember being of any help.",
      ".........I never wanted to go back there again.",
      "For days afterward, the Sonozakis living in Okinomiya—in other words, Mion and Shion's parents, the big name yakuza—would come to our house to apologize, bringing many of their followers with them.",
      "However much my parents refused it, they piled up many hundred thousand yen bills, calling it consolation money, every day.",
      "The amount of money grew each day, and after it had passed two million yen, they were then given an envelope containing a letter.",
      "...I don't know what was written in the letter.",
